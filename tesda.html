            My journey as a TESDA student has been a wonderful experience for me through the years that have passed. I  started as a Computer System Servicing NC II student and got my first training on May 11, 2021. It was a  big adjustment since I had no idea about computers ever since. This might be hard for us since we are 0 experienced and no idea on how this training goes. We conquered the stress, every challenges, specially we are training in the midst of the Pandemic.

        <p class="para2">But, We have overcome the challenges through the help of our trainer, Sir Ronald Surita, and Technical Education Skills and Development Authority (TESDA)</p>
